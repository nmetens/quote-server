# Quote Server
This repo is a learning experience. 

In the Rust Web Dev class taught by Bart Massey, I follow along with his knock-knock
server on GitHub to learn full-stack web development in Rust.

This server shows random famous quotes about love, marriage, life, and stoicism.
These quotes are randomly chosen from a JSON file that was generated by AI each time
the client refreshes the page. 

The methods in this server are asynchronous, so that multiple
Users can access them simultaneously and view different quotes.
