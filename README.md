# Quote Server
This repo is a learning experience. 

In Rust Web Dev class taught by Bart Massey, I follow along his knock-knock
server on GitHub to learn full-stack web development in Rust.

This server shows random famous quotes about love, marriage, life, and stoicism.
These quotes are randomly chosen from a JSON file that was generated by AI each time
the client refreshes the page. 

The methods in this server are async so that multiple
user can access them at the same time and see different quotes.

## Resources
- The [random number](https://rust-random.github.io/book/guide-values.html).
- The json file with random quotes about love, marriage, death, stoicism, and life
were generated using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
