    What This Script Does:
    - Starts the backend in the background and stores its PID.
    - Uses trap to run a cleanup function when the script exits (for Ctrl+C).
    - Kills the backend process and waits for it to terminate.
    - Prevents zombie processes listening on port 8000.
    - Help from ChatGPT to set this up.
